# Jarvis: The Executive OS

**Persistent State • Forensic Logic • Local Sovereignty**

> **Cognitive Architecture** designed to function as a long-term executive assistant. Built for those who require **privacy and continuity**, Jarvis utilizes a custom **Forensic Probability Model (FPM)** to validate intent and a **Persistent JSON State** to maintain a continuous thread of your life across sessions.

## Core Pillars

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 **Forensic Logic Gate**  | A weighted sigmoid-based reasoner (`fpm_engine.py`) that calculates "Engineered Intent." It intercepts high-risk or anomalous commands before execution. |
| 💾 **Persistent Memory**    | Structured `jarvis_state.json` tracks your schedule, tasks, and history. It survives resets and bootstraps every session with your "Ground Truth."       |
| 🎯 **Skill Routing**        | A modular router dispatches intents to specific deterministic skills (Scheduler, Tasks, Weather) only after FPM clearance.                               |
| 📡 **Background Executive** | A dedicated thread monitors your life-state in real-time, triggering notifications (via `ntfy.sh`) and local alerts.                                     |
| 🤵 **Polite Protocol**      | A refined, formal personality that prioritizes utility over conversational fluff. `"Standing by. Good evening, Master."`                                 |

## The FPM (Forensic Probability Model) Layer

The FPM is the **digital conscience** of Jarvis. It evaluates six key variables to determine if a request is **Routine**, **Anomalous**, or **High-Risk** before it is ever processed by the LLM:

| Variable               | Purpose                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **I — Intelligence**   | Complexity and depth of the request split.                |
| **A — Access**         | Proximity to system-critical commands (e.g., Wipe, Root). |
| **M — Material Yield** | Potential for unauthorized data/resource transfer.        |
| **T — Time Pressure**  | Evaluation of urgency or emergency overrides.             |
| **Δ — Dissonance**     | Logical consistency with the established user state.      |
| **D — Detectability**  | Assessment of stealth in the intent.                      |

##  Privacy & Sovereignty

Jarvis is **Local-First**. Your state files, conversation history, and logic gates live **on your hardware**.

No telemetry. No cloud-bound memory. You **own the weights, and you own the data**.

##  Support the Development

Building a cognitive architecture from scratch takes **time, coffee, and focus**.
If Jarvis has improved your workflow or provided a safer way to interact with AI, consider supporting the project.
